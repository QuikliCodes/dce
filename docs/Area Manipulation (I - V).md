# Area Manipulation (I - V)

**Cost: 1 per tier**

## Description

Whether unloading your assault rifle on full-automatic or hurling a ball
of flame, you are exceptionally precise at choosing targets for area
attacks, allowing you to avoid allies who would otherwise be caught in
the line of fire.

## Effect

For each tier of this feat you possess, you can omit a single 5-foot
hex from being targeted as part of an area attack.
