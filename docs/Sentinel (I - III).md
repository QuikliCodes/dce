# Sentinel (I - III)

**Cost: 3 per tier**

## Description

Your heightened awareness on the battlefield means that you are nearly
impossible to catch flat-footed and are always prepared to defend
yourself or allies. This feat is typified by such character concepts as
the bodyguard, the abjurer, and the psychic defender.

## Effect

Once per round, after you have expended your next major action to
perform a defend action, you get an additional major action that must be
spent before the start of your next turn to make another defend action.
Multiple tiers of this feat grant additional major actions usable only
for defend actions.
