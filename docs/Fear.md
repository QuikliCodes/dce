# Fear

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 5
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Special

## Attributes

-   Power
-   Spirit

## Description

Through an overwhelming force of physical might or extraordinary power,
you strike terror into the hearts of enemies, causing them to flee from
your presence. A warrior might invoke this bane by hurling a boulder
while a cyber hacker might achieve the same effect by uploading a
hallucinatory virus into an opponent's neuro jack.

## Effect

On its turn, the afflicted target must use its entire turn to get as far
away as possible from you. It cannot use its actions to do anything
other than retreat, and it cannot willingly move closer to you while the
bane persists.
