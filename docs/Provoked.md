## Description

Through a display of awe-inspiring force, intimidation, or leadership,
you command attention as the greatest threat, causing others to fear
attacking your allies. Examples include a brute smashing the skull of a
lesser foe, a gunslinger hurling insults, or a space captain diving into
the middle of a swirling melee with plasma blades flashing.

## Effect

Any attacks made by the target that do not include you as a target
suffer disadvantage. If the same target is affected by this bane from
multiple sources, as long as their attack includes one of those who
targeted them, they are not affected by the penalty. Unlike other banes,
your damaging attack against one target can trigger this bane in a
different target, provided your roll is greater than or equal to their
Resolve defense (that is, by striking one foe, you can provoke another).

-   **Power Level 4** - The target suffers disadvantage 1 on attacks
    that do not include you.
-   **Power Level 5** - The target suffers disadvantage 2 on attacks
    that do not include you.
-   **Power Level 6** - The target suffers disadvantage 3 on attacks
    that do not include you.
-   **Power Level 7** - The target suffers disadvantage 4 on attacks
    that do not include you.
-   **Power Level 8** - The target suffers disadvantage 5 on attacks
    that do not include you.
-   **Power Level 9** - The target suffers disadvantage 6 on attacks
    that do not include you.
