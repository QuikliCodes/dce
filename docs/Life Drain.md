# Life Drain

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 5
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Sustain Persists

## Description

Like the bite of a vampire, the soul draining touch of a black mage, or
the life sucking ray gun of a mad supervillain, this boon allows the
target to steal the very lifeforce of their foes.

## Effect

While this boon persists, the target heals half (round up) of the damage
they inflict with each attack. If an attack damages multiple foes, the
target of this boon heals based on the total damage inflicted against
all foes.
