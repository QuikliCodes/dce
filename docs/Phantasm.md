# Phantasm

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 1
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Special

## Attributes

-   Spirit

## Description

You create an illusory manifestation to deceive the senses. Some
examples include making a meal taste rotten, altering the data on a
screen where a user is logging in, creating the sound of a stampede of
horses, hiding allies behind a false wall, or creating an illusion of an
intergalactic emperor who can converse intelligibly.

## Effect

You create a phantasm of your choosing. The power level at which you
invoke the bane determines which senses you can deceive as well as the
maximum size of your illusion, as follows:

-   **Power Level 1** - Affect Taste. Manifest a 1 hex area
    phantasm.
-   **Power Level 2** - Affect Smell, Sound, or Touch.
-   **Power Level 3** - Affect Sight.
-   **Power Level 4** - Manifest a 2 hex area phantasm.
-   **Power Level 5** - Manifest a 3 hex area phantasm.
-   **Power Level 6** - Affect All Senses.
-   **Power Level 7** - Manifest a 4 hex area phantasm.
-   **Power Level 8** - Manifest a 6 hex area phantasm.
-   **Power Level 9** - Manifest a 8 hex area phantasm.

Until reaching power level 6, you can combine sensory illusions by
adding the required power levels together (e.g., mimicking both sight
and sound requires power level 5). While the phantasm persists, you can
make logical changes to it freely. For example, an illusory person can
speak naturally as you direct it and could be made to fall in response
to an attack. However, substantial changes to the illusion (such as
transforming a human into a goblin) require a new invocation of the
illusion.
