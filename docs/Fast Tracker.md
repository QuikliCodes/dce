**Cost: 2**

## Description

Following a trail is an everyday part of your life, and as such it is no
more taxing than breathing or blinking. Whether you are an experienced
woodsman, a bounty hunter for the Galactic Senate, or a humanoid cat
creature with heightened senses, your expertise at tracking allows you
to get it done faster than the average hunter.

## Effect

You move unhindered and at full speed when tracking your quarry.
