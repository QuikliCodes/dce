# Multi-Target Boon Specialist (I - IX)

**Cost: 2 per tier**

## Description

You are a master of invoking boons for more than one target. A mass
dimensional shift to an intermediary plane and a mass manifestation of
entropic life draining are some examples of what this might look like in
play.

## Effect

For each tier of this feat, you reduce the disadvantage penalty
associated with invoking boons for multiple targets by 1.
