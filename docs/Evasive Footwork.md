# Evasive Footwork

**Cost: 2**

## Description

You are able to dodge and weave in combat, deftly sidestepping attacks
that would threaten a clumsier combatant. An agile ninja who tumbles and
flips around foes and an alien snake creature that slithers throughout
the battlefield are both examples of this feat in play.

## Effect

When you move from a space adjacent to an enemy to another space not
adjacent to that enemy, the enemy does not get the usual opportunity
attack.
