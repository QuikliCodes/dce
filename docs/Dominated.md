# Dominated

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 3
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Special

## Attributes

-   Spirit

## Description

Though rare, domination is seen from time to time in legendary tales,
often wielded by vampires, and sometimes by the most powerful of
sorcerers or mad scientists who command legions of mindless zombies,
completely enslaved to their will.

## Effect

The dominated bane manifests at two levels: lesser and greater. **Lesser
Domination** - The target obeys a one word command until the end of
their next turn, at which time the bane immediately ends. **Greater
Domination** - The target's every action and move is under your
control. Unlike the charmed bane, characters under the effect of
domination lose control of their actions. Their minds, however, struggle
to regain control of their own body. They cannot take actions of any
kind (except thought) unless it is ordered by you. Every action which
the attacker orders the afflicted character to perform which is in
extreme violation of their nature gives the target a resist roll as a
free action to end the effect. The attacker does not gain special access
to the target's mind and so can only order the character to perform
actions that they think the character is capable of. Lastly, each mental
order that the attacker gives to the target is a major action. However,
the order can be a series of verbal commands, such "Attack enemy X
unless someone comes through the door, in which case flee". The
dominated creature will continue to obey the last mental command they
were given until you give a new command. Only one such command can be
active at a given time. Greater Domination has a duration of Resist ends
(Fail x 3 = 1 hour).

-   **Power Level 3** - You can target creatures of subhuman
    intelligence (animals, some elementals, certain undead, etc.) with
    Lesser Domination.
-   **Power Level 5** - You can target creatures of human intelligence
    or better with Lesser Domination. You can target creatures of
    subhuman intelligence (animals, some elementals, etc.) with Greater
    Domination.
-   **Power Level 9** - You can target creatures of human intelligence
    or greater with Greater Domination.
