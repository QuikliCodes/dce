# Reach

Reach is the distance a character can attack with a melee attack. The value depends on the size of the character.

| Size    | Reach   | # hexes occupied |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| Small   | 1 tile  | 1                |
| Medium  | 1 tile  | 1                |
| Large   | 2 tiles | 3                |
| Huge    | 3 tiles | 7                |

Creatures larger than huge should be broken into multiple individual combat tokens with their own sizes.
