## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 5
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Sustain Persists

## Description

Through supernatural magic or extrasensory perception, you reach out and
connect with an object or place, gaining the ability to read residual
information from it and divine what has occurred in its vicinity in the
past. This boon is common among psychics, detectives, and specialized
hunters.

## Effect

When you successfully invoke this boon, you gain information from an
object or place within range as follows:

-   **Power Level 5** - The target can read vague ideas and impressions
    to learn what took place near the object or place within the past
    hour.
-   **Power Level 6** - The target can see a vivid vision, similar to a
    recording, of what took place near the object or place within the
    last hour.
-   **Power Level 7** - The target can ascertain the most recent owner
    of the object or the people who have most recently been in a place.
    This knowledge grants enough information for your target to use the
    spying bane to locate or view those identified.
-   **Power Level 8** - Choose one: The target sees a vision of the most
    recent significant event that took place in close proximity to the
    object or place - OR - the target asks whether or not a specific
    event is impressed upon the object or place.
-   **Power Level 9** - The target is able, given sufficient time, to
    access all memories impressed upon the object or place. You must
    maintain concentration, with each 10 minutes yielding a new vision
    from the object's or place's past. The GM determines the order in
    which the information is revealed. At the GM's discretion,
    concealed or particularly distant memories may require a much longer
    time to discover.
