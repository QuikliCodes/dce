# Turn Actions

On your turn, you can take:
- 1 Major Action
- 1 Move Action
- Any number of unique Minor Actions

Alternatively, you can forgo all of the above to take **1 Focus Action**.

## Major Actions

- **Make a Damaging Attack:**
    - Damage = (Attack Roll Total) - (Target's Defense). Minimum damage is the attribute score for the attacking attribute
    - **Exceptional Success:** If your roll exceeds the target's defense by 10 or more, you can apply a bane or cancel a boon on the target.
- **Make a Bane Attack:** Roll an appropriate attribute against the target's relevant defense. On a success, the target suffers the bane.
- **Invoke a Boon:** Roll an attribute against the CR from the Boon Challenge Rating table. Your roll determines the maximum power level you can invoke, capped by your attribute score.
- **Assist an Ally:** Grant an ally advantage 1 on an action roll.
- **Take an Extra Move Action:** You can trade your Major Action for a second Move Action.

## Multi-Targeting

Attacking multiple targets incurs disadvantage.

- **Melee:** Disadvantage equal to the number of targets.
- **Ranged:** Disadvantage equal to the number of targets (max 5 targets within a 2 radius sphere).
- **Area (Typically Magic):**
  - **Single Target:** No disadvantage
  - Area targeting has 3 modes:
    * **Sphere:** Originates on in the middle of a hex within range. Radius is the number of neighboring rings of hexes are included.
      - Disadvantage = 2 * Radius
    * **Cone:** Originates on the caster's hex, but does not impact that hex, and forms a triangle a chosen direction that forms a triangle with 2 additional hexes.
      - Disadvantage = 1 for the smallest possible triangle, +1 for each additional row of hexes added
    * **Line:**: Originates on the caster's hex, but does not impact that hex, and forms a line in a chosen direction, which must be directly toward an adjacent hex.
      - Disadvantage = 1 for every 2 hex tiles added in that line.

## Move Actions

- Move up to your speed.
- Take special movement (Jump, Climb, Swim).
- **Resist Banes:** You can use an action to try to resist a bane.  For
instance, if you are on fire and have an ability to conjure water, you can try
to put yourself out by conjuring water.  Make an action roll for your ability
against the CR of the rank of the bane you which to resist.  If you have no
valid abilities to use, you can still make a roll using a d20 to try to resist
it with a straight roll.

## Minor Actions

You can take any number of **unique** minor actions, for instance, you cannot take two opportunity attacks in one round.
Your minor actions refresh at the start of your turn.

- **Opportunity Attack:** if an enemy leaves your melee reach, you may make an attack against them.
- **Sustain a Boon:** Use a minor action to continue a boon with a "sustain persists" duration for another round. You can typically only sustain one boon at a time.
- Other examples: Draw/sheathe a weapon, retrieve an item, open a door.

## Focus Actions

Requires forgoing all other actions for the turn.

- **Superior Action:** Make any one action roll with advantage 1.
- **Charge:** Move up to twice your speed and make one melee attack with disadvantage 1.

## Interrupt Actions

Can be taken in response to another's action, but costs your next Major Action.

- **Defend:** After an enemy's successful attack, make an attribute roll. If your roll is higher, it replaces the targeted defense score for that attack.
- **Improvise:** Take a reasonable non-offensive action to react to a situation, with GM approval.
