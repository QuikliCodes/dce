# Telepathy

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 3
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Sustain Persists

## Description

You reach out mentally to a willing target and speak wordlessly with
thought-to-thought communication. Examples of this boon in action
include a psychic who can connect with the minds of others and a far
future artificial intelligence capable of passing information to other
beings through the vibration of quantum strings.

## Effect

You and the target can communicate with each other simply through
thought. Note that this telepathy does not bestow intelligence upon
creatures, so you could not use it to communicate with a squirrel unless
you already possessed other means of doing so. Additionally, telepathy
does not bypass language barriers, so you would need to already speak
the language of your target.

-   **Power Level 3** - You can communicate telepathically with a single
    creature of animal-level intelligence or lower. Keep in mind that it
    can only communicate concepts with you that it can understand.
-   **Power Level 5** - You can communicate telepathically with a single
    creature of humanoid intelligence.
-   **Power Level 6** - You can create a mental relay between yourself
    and up to five other creatures allowing each of them to communicate
    with the rest of the group simultaneously.
-   **Power Level 7** - You can communicate telepathically with any
    number of creatures that you can see.
