# Challenge Rating

Challenge Rating is a numeric representation of the difficulty of an [Action
Roll](Action Roll.md)

## Average CR by Attribute Score

The average CR for an attribute score can be useful to understand about what CR
would provide a 50/50 chance for success when making an action roll against the
CR.  The CR for most actions should not be set based on the average CR for the
character making the roll, but it can still be useful to understand the
chances.

| Score | CR |
|-------|----|
| 0     | 10 |
| 1     | 12 |
| 2     | 14 |
| 3     | 16 |
| 4     | 18 |
| 5     | 20 |
| 6     | 22 |
| 7     | 24 |
| 8     | 26 |
| 9     | 28 |
| 10    | 30 |

## Determining CR

- Many CRs are defined by the rules (e.g., an opponent's defense score).
- For other tasks, the GM sets the CR based on difficulty:
  - **Everyday (CR 10):** Leaping a 1 hex gap, breaking a simple door.
  - **Challenging (CR 15):** Climbing a rough surface, breaking a strong wooden door.
  - **Heroic (CR 20):** Climbing a smooth surface, leaping a 3 hex gap.
  - **Epic (CR 25):** Translating an alien text, breaking an iron door.
  - **Legendary (CR 30):** Leaping a 5 hex chasm, befriending a sworn enemy.

A character has a roughly 50% chance to succeed at a CR that is "average" for their attribute score (e.g., Attribute Score 4 vs. CR 18).
