# Defensive Mastery

**Cost: 3**

## Description

You know how to turn a strong offense into an even stronger defense.
Your special training or experience with defensive implements and
shields allows you to capitalize on their defensive benefits far beyond
the average wielder. Examples include a martial artist's defensive kata
or a soldier equipped with a riot shield.

## Effect

When wielding a weapon or implement with the *defensive* property, you
gain an additional +1 armor bonus. In addition, the *defensive* value of
the item is increased by 1 when you wield it. So *defensive* 1 becomes
*defensive* 2 and *defensive* 2 becomes *defensive* 3.
