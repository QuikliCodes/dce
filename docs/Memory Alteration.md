# Memory Alteration

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 5
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Instantaneous

## Attributes

-   Spirit

## Description

Warping or controlling the mind is one of the most dreaded powers of
enchanters, causing powerful heroes to forget their homes, families, and
quests. Memory alteration is often inflicted by mad scientists,
necromancers, enchanters, and chronomancers.

## Effect

You alter the target's memories to an extent based on the power level
of the bane.

-   **Power Level 5** - You temporarily modify a minor aspect of the
    target's memory. The target automatically regains the lost memory
    and realizes their confusion 1 hour later.
-   **Power Level 6** - You permanently erase or alter the last 5
    minutes of the target's memory. The target does not know what
    happened during this time outside of the memories you feed them
    (including having seen you, if they did). Multiple uses of this bane
    progressively erase consecutive 5 minute increments.
-   **Power Level 8** - Instead of the immediate past, you can erase or
    alter memories from any time.

The memory alteration bane can only be inflicted via a bane attack.
Damaging attacks that trigger banes cannot trigger this bane. This bane
confers no special ability to know about a target's memory. The invoker
must be aware of the memory either from rumor, personal knowledge,
prescience, or other means.
