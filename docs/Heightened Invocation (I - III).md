# Heightened Invocation (I - III)

**Cost: 2 per tier**

## Description

By channeling your extraordinary powers through extended research or
extensive rituals, such as meditation, fasting, blood letting, or
sacrifices, you are able to increase the strength of your invocations.
This feat is common among wizards, inventors, mad scientists, and
similar characters who use extraordinary abilities to achieve great
deeds.

## Effect

When invoking a bane or boon, you may choose to do so as a heightened
invocation. The invocation time for a heightened invocation is one
increment higher than usual as follows:

-   1 action becomes 1 minute
-   1 minute becomes 10 minutes
-   10 minutes becomes 1 hour
-   1 hour becomes 8 hours
-   8 hours becomes 24 hours

**Tier 1** - When performing a heightened invocation, you may choose one
of the following effects to empower your bane or boon:

-   Increase the range of the effect as follows:
  -   Attribute 5 = 500ft
  - Attribute 6 = 1/2 mile
  - Attribute 7 = 1 mile
  - Attribute 8 = 10 miles
  - Attribute 9 = 100 miles
-   Negate two levels of disadvantage caused by multi-targeting.
-   For your action roll, treat your attribute score as if it was one
    greater for purposes of determining attribute dice. Note that this
    doesn't grant access to banes or boons you could not normally
    access. It only increases the dice used for the action roll.

**Tier 2** - You gain the following options when you perform a
heightened invocation:

-   You can lead others to join you in group invocation as long as they
    are also able to invoke the bane or boon at the same power level
    that you are invoking it at. At the conclusion of the group
    invocation, each contributor may choose one of the effects granted
    by Tier 1 of this feat.
-   You gain the following additional options to choose from when
    empowering your invocations with heightened invocation:
    -   Cause a boon to persist for 1 minute automatically without
        needing to use a sustain action. Furthermore, enemies cannot end
        the boon through use of a disrupting attack (though the
        *nullify* bane still works).
    -   Targets may not make resist rolls against a bane for one minute
        after it is invoked.

**Tier 3** - You gain the ability to permanently bestow or dispel banes
and boons. In order to bestow the bane or boon, you must rigorously
attend to the invocation process for a number of days equal to the power
level of the bane or boon to be invoked or nullified. During that time
you can eat, sleep, and act normally with two exceptions: 1) You must
work actively on the invocation and with minimal interruption for 8
hours out of each day. 2) You can leave the area and move about freely
during the down time each day, but for the 8 hours of active heightened
invocation you must be in the same physical or geographic location where
the invocation was initiated. When the invocation time is completed,
make an action roll as follows:

-   **Bestow Boon** - Make an action roll to invoke the boon as usual.
    If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent boon to
    permanently affect the target. The target can thereafter invoke the
    boon at will with a free action, without requiring an action roll to
    do so. The target does not need to use a sustain action to persist
    the effect, and the effect can only be nullified either temporarily
    with the *nullify* bane, or permanently with the Heightened
    Invocation feat (see the Dispel Boon entry that follows).
-   **Bestow Bane** - Make an action roll to invoke the bane as usual.
    If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent bane to
    permanently affect the target. The bane persists indefinitely and
    does not allow resist rolls to end its effects. The effect can be
    canceled either temporarily with the *nullify* bane, or permanently
    with the Heightened Invocation feat (see the Dispel Bane entry that
    follows).
-   **Dispel Boon** - Make an [Spirit](Spirit.md) roll with a Challenge Rating equal
    to 10 + twice the power level of the boon you are attempting to
    dispel. If successful, you cause a permanent boon to be forever
    stripped from the target, causing them to lose the ability to invoke
    the boon automatically.
-   **Dispel Bane** - Make a [Spirit](Spirit.md) roll with a Challenge Rating
    equal to 10 + twice the power level of the bane you are attempting
    to dispel. If successful, you break the curse of a permanent bane
    afflicting the target, though your target gains no special immunity
    to it.
