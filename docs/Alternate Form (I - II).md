# Alternate Form (I - II)

**Cost: 3 per tier**

## Description

You have the ability to transform from one persona to another, whether
that be through bodily transformation like a werewolf or through
exterior mechanisms, such as a cybernetically enhanced soldier who can
call forth a symbiotic mech suit.

## Effect

Upon taking this feat, you build a single alternate form using the
normal character creation rules, though your attribute and feat points
are determined by your tier in this feat: \* \*\*Tier 1:\*\* Half of
your primary form's attribute points (rounded up), and 3 feat points.
\* \*\*Tier 2:\*\* Same attribute points as your primary form, and 3
feat points less than your primary form. Whenever your primary form
gains new attribute points or levels up, your alternate form also gains
points according to the above formulas. As a focus action, you may
change between any two forms (including your primary form or any
alternate form). You maintain this capability in all of your forms. Each
form is treated as a completely different character for mechanical
purposes - possessing different attributes, feats, perks, flaws, and
other defining characteristics. Your alternate form does, however,
retain the ability to transform back into your primary form. In order to
keep track of hit points, you should always record the total damage that
your character has suffered. When transforming, your damage remains with
you even if your maximum hit points change. For example, Dr. Jekyll has
a max HP of 15 and Mr. Hyde has a max HP of 30. During combat, Mr. Hyde
suffers 10 damage. When he later transforms back into Dr. Jekyll, the 10
damage remains and is subtracted from his new maximum, leaving the
doctor with 5 out of 15 hit points. Additionally, when changing forms,
if your hit points would be reduced to less than 1, your hit point total
becomes 1 instead.
