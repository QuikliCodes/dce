# Untrackable

**Cost: 1**

## Description

Whether this power manifests itself as vines that grow in your wake, a
magical ward against detection, or an illusory veil, the effect is the
same: you are protected from being tracked.

## Effect

Your travel is veiled by special means that conceal your tracks and any
evidence of your passage even after you are far away. It is impossible
to follow your tracks except by extraordinary means.
