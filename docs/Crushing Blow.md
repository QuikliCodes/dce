# Crushing Blow

**Cost: 3**

## Description

Like a reckless ogre wading through combat, your relentless blows not
only knock your opponents back, but also knock them off their feet
completely.

## Effect

Any time that you deal damage to an enemy, in addition to pushing them 5
feet (if you choose) from the Overpowering Strike feat, you can also
knock them down in the space where the forced move ends; the target
suffers the effects of the *knockdown* bane.
