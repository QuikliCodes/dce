# Shapeshift

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 2
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Sustain Persists

## Description

A target's physical structure is temporarily altered, allowing it to
assume the form of potentially any creature no matter how fantastic or
exotic. Common examples of shapeshifting include lyncanthropes (such as
werewolves), amorphous alien lifeforms, dopplegangers, and certain types
of druids.

## Effect

The target transforms into a creature whose highest attribute is less
than or equal to your [Spirit](Spirit.md) score. With the exception of
[Spirit](Spirit.md), all of the target's extraordinary attribute scores drop to
zero, and they acquire the [Speed](Speed.md), [Recovery](Recovery.md), and [Power](Power.md)
attributes of the new form. The GM, not the player, is responsible for
deciding the attributes and abilities of creature. It is recommended
that this creature follow the guidelines established by the "Simple
Build" section for creating NPCs in Chapter 8: Running the Game. In
order to keep track of hit points, the target should record the total
damage they have suffered. When transforming, damage remains with the
character even if their maximum hit points change. For example, Vera has
a max HP of 20 but is turned into a dragon and her [Recovery](Recovery.md) increases
from 5 to 9, increasing her hit points to 28. During combat, she suffers
10 damage. When she later transforms back into her human form, the 10
damage remains and is subtracted from her new maximum, leaving her with
10 out of 20 hit points. Additionally, if the shift would reduce the
target's hit points to less than 1, the target's hit point total
becomes 1 instead. Limitations are applied starting at power level 2 and
are gradually removed at higher power levels:

-   **Power Level 2** - The new form cannot be a different size than
    that of the target. It must possess similar physiology to the
    target. Examples of different physiology classifications include
    animals, plants, elementals, and oozes. This list is not exhaustive,
    and the GM has final say as to what forms are allowed. The target
    does not gain alternate forms of movement (flight, swimming,
    climbing, burrowing, etc.). The target does not gain extraordinary
    attributes of the new form (hence, they cannot inflict banes that
    rely on the creature's extraordinary attributes).
-   **Power Level 3** - Shapeshift into a creature between half and
    double the target's original size. Gain any non-flight movement
    modes of the new form.
-   **Power Level 4** - Shapeshift into a creature between one quarter
    and quadruple the target's original size.
-   **Power Level 5** - Gain the flying movement mode of the new form,
    if applicable.
-   **Power Level 6** - Shapeshift into a living creature of a different
    physiology, such as an elemental, ooze, or a plant.
-   **Power Level 7** - Gain all extraordinary attributes possessed by
    the new form. If both forms have an [Spirit](Spirit.md) attribute, the target
    chooses between the two scores.
-   **Power Level 8** - Shapeshift into a creature of any size.
