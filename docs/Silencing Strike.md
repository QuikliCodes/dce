# Silencing Strike

**Cost: 3**

## Description

Like an expert assassin or ninja, you can render your foes completely
unable to alert others of your presence. This might take the form of a
dart to the larynx, a garrote around the throat, or simply a sturdy
covering of the mouth.

## Effect

Whenever you deal damage using a weapon with the precise property to a
target that is caught off guard or otherwise unaware of the attack, such
as when you are hidden from them, disguised as a friend, or have
successfully deceived them, the target is afflicted with the *silenced*
bane.
