## Description

Utilizing either incredible precision or the power of entropy, you snuff
out the target's life force completely. The deadliest assassins and
most powerful necromancers are known for such legendary skill at ending
life.

## Effect

Upon a successful invocation, the target is immediately rendered
immobile, unconscious, and unable to take actions. They have
disadvantage 5 on all [Spirit](Spirit.md) rolls, and any damaging attacks against
them count as finishing blows. If the target fails three resist rolls to
shake off this bane, they die. The death is permanent and can only be
reversed if the GM allows a special mission, use of a rare technology,
or long-forgotten magic to restore the target to life.
