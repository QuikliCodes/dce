# Hit Points

Hit points, or HP, are a numerical representation of the well-being of a
character. Normally you only track your damage, rather than your current hit
points, so "Hit Points" here is in regards to the maximum damage a character
can take before entering a dying state.

**Calculation:** 2 x (Power + Spirit + Recovery) + 10

## Damage Types

Damage can come in 2 types, Normal or Lethal.  Normal damage heals more easily than Lethal Damage.

## Recovering Damage

A character can spend an uninterrupted hour resting, and can roll a Recovery
[Action Roll](Action Roll.md) for the [Heal](Heal.md) boon upon
completion to try to heal some normal damage.

Lethal damage is healed at a rate of [Recovery](Recovery.md) + 1 points per good night's rest.

## Reaching Zero Hit Points

When damage accumulated (Normal and Lethal combined) reaches the Hit Points maximum, the character is considered at Zero HP.  They become unconscious and are susceptible to a [Finishing Blow](Finishing Blow.md).

## Ad Hoc Damage

For damage from non-attack sources like traps or falling. The GM assigns a severity level and rolls the corresponding damage dice. This damage can be designated as lethal.

- **Light (1-4):** 1d4 to 1d10 damage.
- **Moderate (5-7):** 2d6 to 2d10 damage.
- **Heavy (8-10):** 3d8 to 4d8 damage.
