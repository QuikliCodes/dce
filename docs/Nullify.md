# Nullify

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 1
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Instantaneous

## Attributes

-   Spirit

## Description

Through magical power, technological hacking, or similar means, you are
able to nullify your enemy's boons. The nullify bane is often used by
abjurers, engineers, bards, and similar characters built to neutralize
the powers of their enemy.

## Effect

You cancel a single boon currently in effect if it is of this bane's
power level or lower. The invoking power level further impacts the
effect as follows:

-   **Power Level 1** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 1. You can cancel a
    boon that must be actively invoked. In addition, the target cannot
    benefit from or have the target boon invoked upon them for 1 minute.
-   **Power Level 2** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 2.
-   **Power Level 3** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 3.
-   **Power Level 4** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 4.
-   **Power Level 5** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 5.
-   **Power Level 6** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 6. You can cancel a
    boon that is permanent, passive, or inherent to the target (e.g. the
    invisibility of a Will o' Wisp). Effects that would prevent Nullify
    from being invoked in this way have no effect. In addition, the
    target cannot benefit from or have the target boon invoked upon them
    for 1 minute.
-   **Power Level 7** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 7.
-   **Power Level 8** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 8.
-   **Power Level 9** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 9.
