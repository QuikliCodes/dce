# Special Attacks

Special attacks are attacks empowered by essence abilities.
If you have the Fire essence, that doesn't mean you can make an attack utilizing it.
A special attack will grant an ability that channels that essence into a type of attack, giving it form.

A special attack should specify:

1. The type of attack (Melee, Ranged, or Magic)
2. The defense score it targets (Guard, Toughness, or Resolve)
3. Whether multi-targeting applies and in what form, for instance:
    - A melee swing that goes in a frontal arc
    - A fireball filling a radius
    - A hail of arrows in a cone
