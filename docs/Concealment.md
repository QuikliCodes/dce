## Description

and similar characters.

## Effect

**NOTE:** This replaces the Invisible Boon, published in Issue 01 of
Every Roll Matters Zine (December 2021).

The invoker may choose one sensory element (such as Scent, Sound, Light, Heat,
etc) to restrict. This causes all such elements of the chosen type to be
suppressed within 1 hex of the target though extraordinary means, making it very
difficult to detect. The target gains advantage according to the boon's Power
Level on Action rolls to hide and/or remain undetected.

When making attacks against enemies that are unable to detect the
target, their Guard defense is reduced. Likewise, the target's Guard
defense is increased against enemies that can not detect them, though is
unchanged against area attacks.

You cannot be the target of opportunity attacks unless the enemy is
somehow aware of your location through another sensory element,
applicable attribute roll, or other effect that allows them to locate
you. This opportunity attack may be subject to disadvantage (0, 3, or 5)
as determined by the GM for the given situation.
