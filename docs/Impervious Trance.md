# Impervious Trance

**Cost: 3**

## Description

In the heightened focus of battle, your will becomes indomitable. Like a
monk with unflinching mental focus or a berserker who is too
bloodthirsty to be stopped, you cannot be thwarted by fear, charm, or
similar attempts to overcome your willpower.

## Effect

While you are in a battle trance, you are immune to banes that target
your Resolve. If you were already under the effect of such a bane, it is
negated for the duration of your battle trance and returns when your
battle trance ends.
