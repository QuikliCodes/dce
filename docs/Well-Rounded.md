**Cost: 2**

## Description

plain old good luck. The result is that you're pretty good at things
you're not specialized in.

## Effect

Any time you use an attribute with a score of 2 or less to make an
action roll outside of combat that is not a bane or boon invocation, you
gain advantage 1 to the roll.
