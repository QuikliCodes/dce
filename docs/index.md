# Dungeon Crawler Earth

This is a tabletop role-playing game based on the open source "Open Legend"
system, but heavily modified to fit in with the mechanics from a lit-RPG book
named "He who Fights with Monsters", in which characters absorb essences to
unlock the infinite power within their souls.  These essences allow the
characters to ascend [Ranks](Rank.md) inspired by competitive ladders of online games:
Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond.

## The Core Mechanic

The core mechanic of the system is the [Action Roll](Action Roll.md), which is
used to determine the outcome of all actions that could fail.

## Character Creation

* Ask the GM what [Rank](Rank.md) you are starting at
* Pick a [Race](Race.md)
* Buy your [Attributes](Attributes.md)
* [Purchase Feats](Feats.md)
