# Rank

Ranks follow competitive rank ladders from online games.

## Character Ranks

If starting unranked, characters start as completely normal people, with no
extraordinary attributes, feats, or abilities.  They will progress their
supernatural abilities as they progress to bronze rank.  Characters have a number
of Attribute Points, Feat Points, and Abilities at each rank as shown on the chart.

## Rank Disparity

To make the power gap between ranks meaningful, characters gain advantage or
disadvantage when facing opponents of a different rank tier (i.e. Bronze,
Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond). Ranks within a tier (e.g. Gold I vs Gold II)
are considered equal for this rule.

The bonus is cumulative based on the difference in tiers:

-   **vs. 1 Tier Difference** (e.g. Silver vs Gold): Advantage/Disadvantage 1
-   **vs. 2 Tiers Difference** (e.g. Silver vs Platinum): Advantage/Disadvantage 2

A character has disadvantage on actions against characters of a higher rank tier,
and advantage on actions against characters of a lower rank tier.
