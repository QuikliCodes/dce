## Description

You force an opponent to lose control of an object they are holding,
whether through brute force, mental compulsion, a skillful parry,
heating the item to unbearable temperatures, shooting it from their
hands, or some other means.

## Effect

-   **Power Level 3** - The target drops an object they are holding in a
    space of your choosing within 3 hexes of the target.
-   **Power Level 6** - As an alternative to moving the item, you can
    choose to assume control of it. If you do, you are now the wielder.
    For the wielder to regain control, they can react with a Disarmed
    bane of their own to counter the effect or make an attribute roll
    (typically [Power](Power.md)) with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + 2 x the
    attribute score you used to disarm the item.
