# Boon Focus (I - III)

**Cost: 3 per tier**

## Description

You are specialized in the use a particular boon that is iconic to your
character. Examples of this feat in action include a druid who can
shapechange at-will, a combat medic who can tend the wounds of many with
expert skill, and a mad scientist who can animate mechanical minions
effortlessly.

## Effect

Choose a single boon that you can invoke. You gain benefits with that
boon according to your tier in this feat.

-   **Tier 1** - When you invoke the chosen boon on a single target, you
    succeed automatically and do not need to make an action roll. You
    can invoke the boon at any of the power levels you could access via
    your other means. If the invocation is not a single target, success
    is not automatic, but you get advantage 2 on the action roll to
    invoke the boon.
-   **Tier 2** - You gain advantage 3 on your action roll to invoke the
    boon if you are not single-targeting. Additionally, you may invoke
    the boon one time increment faster, as follows: If the invocation
    time is a major action or move action, it becomes a minor action. If
    the invocation time is 1 focus action, it becomes 1 major action. If
    the invocation time is 1 minute, it becomes 1 focus action. If the
    invocation time is 10 minutes, it becomes 1 minute. If the
    invocation time is 1 hour, it becomes 10 minutes. If the invocation
    time is 8 hours, it becomes 1 hour. If the invocation time for a
    boon is 1 minor action, it can be invoked only once as a minor
    action. Beyond that it can be invoked by expending a move or major
    action.
-   **Tier 3** - The effect at tier 3 varies based on the duration of
    the boon: **If the chosen boon has a duration of "sustain persists"**, you
    gain advantage 4 on your action roll to invoke if you are not
    single-targeting. Additionally, one instance of the boon can be
    sustained each round as a free action, rather than a minor action.
    If the boon is somehow temporarily canceled, in the absence of other
    rules, you can invoke it again as a free action. If targeted by the
    *nullify* bane, this effect can only be canceled by a power level 6
    or greater invocation of that bane. **If the boon has a different duration**,
    you gain advantage 5 on your action roll to invoke if you are not single-targeting.
