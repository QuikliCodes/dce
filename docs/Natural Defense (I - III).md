# Natural Defense (I - III)

**Cost: 2 per tier**

## Description

Whether through draconic heritage, a cyborg exoskeleton, or just a
lifetime of conditioning, your skin is tough as nails, allowing your
body to deflect blows that would cripple others.

## Effect

When you are not wearing armor, you gain a bonus to your Guard and
Toughness defenses. Your bonus is determined by your tier in this feat:

-   **Tier 1** - +1 bonus to Guard and Toughness.
-   **Tier 2** - +2 bonus to Guard and Toughness.
-   **Tier 3** - +3 bonus to Guard and Toughness.
