# Flying

**Cost: 3**

## Description

Whether through a pair of celestial or infernal wings, an inherent
telekinetic force, or mutant super powers, you possess the ability to
fly.

## Effect

You gain a flight speed equal to your normal speed. At the GM's
discretion, certain hostile actions may be capable of canceling your
flight, sending you hurtling to your doom. If your flight is anatomical,
the *immobile* bane might render your wings immovable. If telekinetic,
an application of the *nullify* bane may cancel your flight.
