# Resistance

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 3
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Sustain Persists

## Description

Whether through a magical force field, an elemental wall, self-attaching
body armor, or a temporary mutation, the target becomes resistant to the
effects of damage from a certain type of attack. This boon is common
among abjurers, engineers, telekinetisists, and elemental mages.

## Effect

When the boon is invoked, the invoker chooses one type of attack and the
target gains resistance to that type. The types include precise,
forceful, fire, cold, lightning, acid, influence, and entropy (other
types may be approved by the GM). The effect of the resistance is
determined by the power level of the boon (the following are not
cumulative):

-   **Power Level 3** - The target's defense scores are increased by 3
    against the chosen attack type.
-   **Power Level 5** - The target's defense scores are increased by 6
    against the chosen attack type.
-   **Power Level 7** - The target's defense scores are increased by 9
    against the chosen attack type.
-   **Power Level 9** - The target is immune to damage and harmful
    effects from the chosen attack type.
