## Description

Incapacitation is a catch-all bane for a variety of effects, including
total paralysis, sleep, petrification, poison, being knocked out,
fainting, or similar conditions that render a character completely
helpless. Examples of possible causes of this bane include a martial
artist's paralyzing strike, an enchanter's magical song of sleep,
paralysis by poison, fainting from extreme heat, suffocation, and the
gaze of a medusa.

## Effect

The target is immobile (can't move from their current space) and
unconscious. They have disadvantage 5 on all perception rolls and are
incapable of moving. As a result of being completely incapable of
movement, an incapacitated character can be the victim of a finishing
blow.

-   **Power Level 5** - The effect can be broken by a moderate
    disruption, such as a firm shove, a kick, glass of water, loud bang,
    etc.
-   **Power Level 7** - The effect can only be broken if the target
    takes 1 point of damage or more.
-   **Power Level 9** - The effect cannot be disrupted by external
    forces. Only the afflicted character's successful resist roll can
    end the effect.
