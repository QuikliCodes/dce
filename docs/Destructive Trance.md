# Destructive Trance

**Cost: 3**

## Description

In the heat of combat, you become a destructive force to be reckoned
with. Whether a raging barbarian or a hyper-focused intergalactic
knight, your attacks become particularly ferocious when you enter your
battle trance.

## Effect

When you make an attack roll in a battle trance, all of the dice in your
dice pool explode on either maximum or the number 1 below maximum
(though the total is still the number rolled). This means that d4s
explode on a 3 or 4, d6s explode on a 5 or 6, d8s explode on a 7 or 8,
and so on.
