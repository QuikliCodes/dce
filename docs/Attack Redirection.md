# Attack Redirection

**Cost: 3**

## Description

You are adept at redirecting your enemy's attacks. Whether using fancy
footwork, magical force, or tactical superiority, you know how to force
your enemy to attack unintended targets.

## Effect

When you make a defend action and your roll exceeds the attacker's
action roll, you can choose to redirect the attack to a target that is
neither you, nor the attacker. The original attack roll does not change,
only the target. If the attack was a melee attack, you can redirect it
to anyone within 1 hex of you (as opposed to within 1 hex of the attacker).
