# Extraordinary Healing

**Cost: 3**

## Description

Whether you summon priestly magics, utilize advanced technologies, or
apply alchemical concoctions, your mastery of extraordinary healing is
such that you are able to cure mortal wounds that are beyond the power
of the average healer.

## Effect

When invoking the *heal* boon, you can choose to take one hour instead
of the usual invocation time. If you do, you heal an amount of lethal
damage equal to the total healing from the successful boon invocation.
This lethal damage is healed in addition to the normal hit point damage
that your boon heals.
