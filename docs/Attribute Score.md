# Attribute Score

Attribute score determines the number and size of attribute dice that are used when making an [Action Roll](Action Roll.md) with an [Attribute](Attributes.md).

## Spending Attribute Points

A character can spend attribute points to increase an attribute score. The cost
to increase a score by 1 is the same as the value of the new score.  For
instance, to increase a score from 3 to 4, the cost is 4.  This cost is
cumulative, such that to buy a score of 4 from scratch, the cost is the cost to
go from 0->1, plus the cost to go from 1->2, plus the cost to go from 2->3,
plus the cost to go from 3->4, or 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.  For convenience, this
cumulative total is in the table below.


| Score/Upgrade Cost | Average CR | Total Cost | Dice |
|--------------------|------------|------------|------|
| 0                  | 10         | 0          | None |
| 1                  | 12         | 1          | 1d4  |
| 2                  | 14         | 3          | 1d6  |
| 3                  | 16         | 6          | 1d8  |
| 4                  | 18         | 10         | 1d10 |
| 5                  | 20         | 15         | 2d6  |
| 6                  | 22         | 21         | 2d8  |
| 7                  | 24         | 28         | 2d10 |
| 8                  | 26         | 36         | 3d8  |
| 9                  | 28         | 45         | 3d10 |
| 10                 | 30         | N/A        | 4d8  |
