# Extraordinary Defense (I - III)

**Cost: 3 per tier**

## Description

Whether by a magical barrier of force, foresight into the future, or
preternatural speed, you are gifted with extraordinary protection from
harm. Attacks are less likely to strike you, and when they do, they
aren't as damaging as they would be to others.

## Effect

You gain a +1 bonus to all defenses for each tier you have in this feat.
This increases your Toughness, Guard, and Resolve defenses.
