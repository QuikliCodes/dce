# Light

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 1
-   Invocation Time: 1 Minor Action
-   Duration: Sustain Persists

## Description

Whether through magical summoning, energy manipulation, or some other
means, you illuminate an area with a bright light. An android activating
its head lamp, a fire mage creating a dancing torch flame, and an
alchemist cracking a glow globe are all examples of this boon in play.

## Effect

Choose a space or object within range. Extraordinary light emanates from
the target to a radius equal five feet per power level of the boon. If
the light area overlaps an area affected by the darkness boon, then the
one of greater power level supersedes the other. If the power level of
both is equal, then they cancel each other out.
