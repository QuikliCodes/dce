# Mimic

**Cost: 2**

## Description

You have honed your shapeshifting abilities to be able to not only
change your form, but to even imitate specific creatures. Your powers
may stem from studying the arts of deceptive magic, from a gene
mutation, or even from innate extraordinary abilities.

## Effect

When you use the *shapeshift* boon, you may take on the features of a specific
creature. For example, instead of merely transforming into an elf, you can
assume the guise of Galdion the elven king. The disguise is near perfect for
those examining you visually. If your behavior or other signs provide
reasonable suspicion, an onlooker can attempt a [Spirit](Spirit.md) roll with a
Challenge Rating equal to 10 + triple your [Spirit](Spirit.md) score, whichever
is higher. If they succeed, they will recognize your disguise.
