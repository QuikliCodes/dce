# Mounts & Vehicles

These are both handled mechanically the same.

- **Actions:** The rider/pilot can allocate any of their own [actions](Turn Actions.md) to the
mount, using the mount's attributes and feats for the action.
- **Damage Threshold (DT):** When a vehicle reaches 0 [HP](Hit Points.md), it gains one damage
level and its [HP](Hit Points.md) resets to maximum. It suffers disadvantage on all action rolls
equal to its current damage level. If its damage level reaches its Damage
Threshold, it is disabled.
