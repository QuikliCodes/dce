# Precognition

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 1
-   Invocation Time: 1 Minute
-   Duration: 1 round

## Description

You peer into the future to gain insight into a course of action, an
event, a person, or a place. Examples of this boon include a fortune
teller throwing the bones, a superhuman detective analyzing evidence, a
priest consulting a higher power for direction, and an advanced
artificial intelligence calculating every possible outcome of a complex
assortment of variables.

## Effect

-   **Power Level 1** - The target asks a question about a course of
    action they plan to take within the next five minutes. The GM
    communicates the insight through vague symbols, impressions, or a
    single word such as "favorable" or "unfavorable".
-   **Power Level 3** - The target asks a question about a course of
    action they plan to take within the next hour. The GM communicates
    the insight through vague symbols, impressions, or a single word
    such as "favorable" or "unfavorable".
-   **Power Level 5** - The target asks a single question about a
    particular event, decision, person, place, etc. The GM provides a
    meaningful (not vague, but still brief) explanation in one or two
    sentences that is a direct response to the knowledge the target
    seeks. Only one question can be asked about a given subject each
    week.
-   **Power Level 7** - The target can choose a particular event,
    decision, person, place, etc. After invoking this boon, the target
    begins to have extraordinary encounters (visions, trances, dreams,
    out-of-body experiences, etc.) through which the GM will provide the
    target with detailed information about the subject of your
    prescience. You can only maintain one such subject at a given time,
    however concentration is not required to maintain this state, it is
    perpetuated until you either choose to end it, or you choose to
    shift your focus.
