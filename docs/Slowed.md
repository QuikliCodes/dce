## Description

The target's movement is impaired, either by extreme cold, prolonged
heat, poison, or injury to one or both legs. This bane is a favored
attack among rogues, ice mages, telekinetisists, and gunslingers.

## Effect

The afflicted target's speed is reduced to half its current speed,
rounded down to the nearest 1 hex increment. This applies to all movement
that is physical (flight, walking, climbing, etc.). If the target is
currently under a magical effect that increases speed, the two effects
are canceled for the duration that both affect the target.
