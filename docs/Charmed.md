## Description

Charms are one of the great banes of legend, wielded by powerful
enchantresses like Circe (of Homer's The Odyssey), nymphs, psychics,
and other characters who control the will of others, not through total
domination, but through a magical spell of love or friendship.

## Effect

The charmed bane can only be inflicted via a bane attack. Damaging
attacks that trigger banes cannot trigger this bane. The charmed bane
manifests at two levels: minor and major. **Minor Charm** - The target
is mentally compelled to become more friendly, only changing their
attitude toward you moderately. If they are about to strike you, they
will restrain themselves - still angry and hostile, but no longer
violent. If they want to help you and are leaning toward trusting you,
but have some hesitation because you've just met, then that hesitation
goes away. **Major Charm** - The attacker chooses whether the major
charm is platonic or romantic. If platonic, the bane causes the target
to consider the attacker their best friend and one of the most
trustworthy and noble people they have met in all their lives.
Alternatively, the attacker can choose for this trust and admiration to
manifest as romantic love. The target is unable to do anything to plot
against the one who afflicted them, and will (at the earliest possible
opportunity) tell their charmer of any rumored harm or danger coming
their way. The afflicted character becomes immediately suspicious of
anyone who speaks ill of their attacker. The target is mentally
compelled to like and trust you more, depending on the power level of
the bane when invoked.
