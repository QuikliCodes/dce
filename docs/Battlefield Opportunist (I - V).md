# Battlefield Opportunist (I - V)

**Cost: 2 per tier**

## Description

Your battlefield prowess allows you to capitalize on windows of
opportunity that others don't notice, making you far more deadly in
melee combat. Whether you wield an axe, plasmablade, or your bare fists,
foes struggle to maneuver around or away from you.

## Effect

You may make an additional opportunity attack per round for each tier of
this feat you possess. You can only make one opportunity attack per
triggering action (e.g., you cannot make multiple attacks against the
same foe when they leave your threatened space).
