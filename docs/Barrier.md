# Barrier

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 3
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Sustain Persists

## Description

You summon forth a wall of thorns, ring of fire, swarm of robotic pests,
cloud of entropic fog, or similar barrier to hurt or hinder your foes.

## Effect

When you invoke this boon, you must use multi-targeting to create a
specific area of effect to define the space of your barrier. Upon
successful invocation, choose a number of available properties for your
wall based on your power level:

-   **Power Level 3 -** Choose 1 property: Damaging (1d4), Obscuring,
    Hindering
-   **Power Level 5 -** Choose 2 properties: Damaging (1d8), Obscuring,
    Hindering, Baneful, Mobile
-   **Power Level 7 -** Choose 3 properties: Damaging (1d10), Obscuring,
    Hindering, Baneful, Mobile, Impassable
-   **Power Level 9 -** Choose 4 properties: Damaging (2d6), Obscuring,
    Hindering, Baneful, Mobile, Impassable

**Damaging:** A creature who ends its turn within the barrier or
willingly enters it, automatically suffers the indicated damage. A
creature may only suffer this damage once per round.

**Obscuring:** Creatures cannot see through any part of the barrier or
anything within it.

**Hindering:** Creatures move at half speed when travelling within the
barrier.

**Impassable:** Creatures and objects cannot move through the barrier.
If you place an impassable barrier in a space occupied by a creature,
move that creature to the closest position of their choice that is not
inside of the barrier. This movement does not provoke opportunity
attacks.

**Baneful:** Choose a bane which you can inflict that has a power level
less than or equal to the power level of your barrier. When a creature
ends its turn within the barrier or willingly enters it, you may
immediately make a bane attack against it to inflict the chosen bane. A
creature can only be subject to one such bane attack from this barrier
per round.

**Mobile:** You may spend a major action to move the barrier up to 30
feet.
