# Multi-Bane Specialist

**Cost: 3**

## Description

You have mastered a signature attack that allows you to invoke two banes
at once. A blast of ice that blinds and slows your enemy, a thunderous
shotgun blast that hurls foes back and knocks them to the ground, and a
wormtongue song that puts targets to sleep and alters their memory are
all examples of a signature attack that could be created with this feat.

## Effect

Choose two banes that you are able to inflict and that share a common
prerequisite attribute. You are able to inflict both banes with a single
attack. The required attribute score for combining the banes is equal to
the sum of their power levels (e.g., combining *knockdown* and *slowed*,
both power level 1, would require an attribute score of 2). If the banes
target different defenses, you choose which defense your attack targets.
On a successful attack roll, the target is inflicted with both banes.
They each persist independently of one another and must be resisted
separately.
