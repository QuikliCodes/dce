## Description

Whether by setting the target ablaze, covering them in acid, slicing an
artery, or cursing them with a wasting disease, you inflict your foe
with a lasting and recurring source of damage. Persistent damage is a
favorite among assassins, mad scientists, and elementalists.

## Effect

At the beginning of the target's turn, before they take any actions,
they suffer damage determined by the power level of the bane. This
damage automatically bypasses the afflicted character's defenses but it
can be reduced by any resistance to damage of a certain type (see the
resistance boon). Like all dice rolls, these dice explode.
