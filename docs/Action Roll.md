# Action Roll

The outcome of any meaningful task is determined by an **Action Roll**.

## Performing an Action Roll

1. Take 1d20 and add any bonus dice granted by your character's [attributes](Attributes.md)
2. Roll all dice. Any die that lands on its maximum value "explodes" and is
   rolled again, adding the new result to the total.
3. Sum the results of all dice to get the action roll total.

[Advantage](Advantage.md) can adjust how this roll works

## Determining the Outcome

The action roll total is compared to a [Challenge Rating](CR.md) set by the GM.

1. If the action roll equals or exceeds the challenge rating, the character
   succeeds.
2. If the action roll is less than the challenge rating, the GM decides between
   two options:
  1. Success, with a twist or complication.
  2. Failure, but the story progresses in another way.


## When to Roll

- Roll dice only when the outcome of an action is narratively significant and uncertain.
- Action rolls can be made with an [attribute score](Attribute Score.md) of zero for Physical actions ([Power](Power.md), [Recovery](Recovery.md), or [Speed](Speed.md))
- Action rolls requiring Magical actions requires an essence to be bound to
  [Spirit](Spirit.md) and the nature of the characters essence to be compatible

## Action Roll Outcomes

Every player's action roll must advance the story. A simple failure is not an
option for player characters. This rule does not apply to GM rolls; a GM's
failure is simply a failure.

- **Roll equals or exceeds the [Challenge Rating](CR.md):** The player succeeds.
- **Roll is less than the CR:** The GM chooses one of two outcomes:
  1. **Success with a Twist:** The character achieves their goal, but with an unintended consequence or cost.
  2. **Failure, but the Story Progresses:** The character fails, but the failure introduces a new narrative development.

Players should not attempt to negate a failed roll by having another character
immediately attempt the same or a similar action. The GM's interpretation of
the failed roll's outcome must be resolved first.

## Interpreting Twists and Failures

**Twists** can include: putting a character in danger, expending a resource, making an enemy, wasting time, attracting unwanted attention, or overlooking a key detail.
**Story Progression from Failure** can include: discovering an alternative path to success, escalating the danger, or receiving false information.

## Special Action Roll Types

### Contested Actions

* Used when two or more characters are in direct opposition.
* Each character involved makes an action roll.
* The character with the highest roll succeeds.

### Group Action Rolls

* Used when multiple characters cooperate on a single task.
* All contributing characters make an action roll against the task's [CR](CR.md).
* The outcome is a success if the number of successful rolls is greater than or equal to the number of failed rolls.
* The GM interprets the result as a single group outcome.
