## Description

The stupefied bane has examples in many stories and legends: a
vampire's eyes, a siren's song, and a nymph's beauty are all known to
cast a stupor upon weak-willed mortals. Being stupefied causes the
target to be lulled into a false sense of security, tranquility, and
pacifism.

## Effect

The target is in a state of mental fog, lowering their mental defenses.
While stupefied, the target's Resolve defense is reduced to 10. In
addition, the target has the approximate intelligence of a child. If
attacked, it will defend itself until the attack ceases using its
natural weapons, but the target will never employ any kind of complex
tactic or ability, such as spellcasting. If the target sees fire, it
will run away. If it feels pain, it will flee.
