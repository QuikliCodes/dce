# Insubstantial

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 7
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Sustain Persists

## Description

When a creature becomes insubstantial, it is no longer bound by physical
barriers. Ghosts, wizards assuming gaseous form, and creatures who blink
between dimensions are all exemplars of the insubstantial boon in
action.

## Effect

The target gains the ability to pass freely through all physical barriers as if
they were unoccupied spaces. In addition, they gain the ability to freely move
in any direction in both the horizontal and vertical planes at their base
movement speed. While insubstantial, the target becomes immune to all attacks
that target either Guard or Toughness. However, they also cannot deliver any
attacks that target Guard or Toughness. If concentration is interrupted or the
boon ends while the target is inside of a solid structure, then the target is
forcibly transported to the alternate plane they were traveling by way of at
the time (typically an alternate dimension or plane).
