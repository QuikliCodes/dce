# Lethal Strike (I - IX)

**Cost: 3 per tier**

## Description

Like a highly trained sniper, a ninja of legend, or a feinting melee
dervish, you can devastate your foes with an expertly placed attack when
you catch them off guard.

## Effect

Your attacks are considered lethal strikes whenever you fulfill *one* of
the following conditions:

-   Your target is caught off guard or otherwise unaware of the attack,
    such as when you are hidden from them, disguised as a friend, or
    have successfully deceived them.
-   Your target is within melee attack range of an ally.

You gain advantage on lethal strikes equal to your tier in this feat.
Additionally, a certain portion of the damage (not to exceed the total
damage dealt) is considered lethal damage, which is more difficult to
heal from (see Chapter 7: Combat).

-   **Tier 1** - Advantage 1. Up to 5 lethal damage.
-   **Tier 2** - Advantage 2. Up to 5 lethal damage.
