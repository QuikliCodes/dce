# Detection

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 1
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Sustain Persists

## Description

You gain extraordinary vision that allows you to see colored auras which
correlate to magical, spiritual, or other extraordinary forces. Common
examples of this boon include a paladin detecting a suspect's true
intentions, a psychic reading the aura of a location, and a cyborg
scanning the terrain for signs of life.

## Effect

When calling on this boon, you must choose the type of aura you are
detecting: **holy**, **unholy**, **life**, **death**, or **magic**. You
can perceive invisible auras pertaining to the chosen type of force and
have an approximate sense of their strength (from weak to overwhelming).
These auras are usually based on an action that is deliberate, so an
otherwise kind shopkeeper would radiate an aura of death for a time
after poisoning or killing someone. Even a paladin slaying an evil
archmage will give off a radius of death for a time after the killing
blow.

-   **Holy** - Holy energy surrounds extraplanar beings from the heavens
    or similar good-aligned dimensions where pure goodness is embodied.
-   **Unholy** - Unholy energy surrounds extraplanar beings from the
    hells or similar evil-aligned dimensions where pure evil is
    embodied.
-   **Life** - Beings from heavenly dimensions, far-future regenerative
    nanotech, and clerics wielding the power of healing or protection
    radiate an aura of life for a time after wielding such capabilities.
-   **Death** - Necromancers, undead, and murderers all radiate an aura
    of death. For undead, the aura is constant, since the power of death
    and magic is what animates them.
-   **Magic** - Extraordinary auras surround objects or places imbued
    with such effects. Extraordinary creatures who are innately magical,
    such as a nymph, constantly radiate magic. Natural creatures who
    wield magic, such as a human wizard, give off an aura only following
    use of their power.
