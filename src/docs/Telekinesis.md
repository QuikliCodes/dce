# Telekinesis

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 3
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Sustain Persists

## Description

You reach out and extraordinarily control an unattended inanimate
object. This may stem from latent psychic ability, magical manipulation
of the element of air, anti-gravity technology, or similar sources.

## Effect

Immediately upon invoking the boon, and again each round when you
sustain the boon, you may move the target object up to 1 hex times your
invoking attribute score. As part of moving an object, you may also
manipulate it (for example, turning a door knob or opening a coin
purse). A new invocation of this boon must be attempted whenever you
wish to target a different object. The power level of the boon
determines the size and weight of the objects you may target:

-   **Power Level 3** - The object must be smaller than a 1' cube or
    lighter than 10 pounds.
-   **Power Level 5** - The object must be smaller than a 1 hex area or
    lighter than 100 pounds.
-   **Power Level 7** - The object must be smaller than a 2 hex area or
    lighter than 1,000 pounds.
-   **Power Level 9** - The object must be smaller than a 4 hex area or
    lighter than 10,000 pounds.
