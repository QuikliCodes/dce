# Deathless Trance

**Cost: 3**

## Description

Whether you are a berserker of the icy north, a hulking superhero of
unstoppable might, or a cybernetically enhanced soldier, your battle
fury is legendary. You possess the rare ability to fight on long after
your body should have given up.

## Effect

While in a battle trance you cannot be knocked unconscious. All damage
dealt to you should be recorded, possibly resulting in a negative hit
point total. Despite any amount of damage, you remain conscious for as
long as you can sustain the battle trance. When the battle trance ends,
if your hit points are below zero, you collapse unconscious. If you are
not healed to zero or more hit points within 1 round of your battle
trance ending, you die.
