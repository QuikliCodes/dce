# Diehard

**Cost: 2**

## Description

Whether luck shines upon you or you're just really hard to kill, you
have a knack for staying in the fight when others would tap out. You
might be a plucky rogue who always finds a safe nook to duck into or a
veteran marine specially trained to grit your teeth and buck up when
things look grim.

## Effect

Once per day, an attack that would reduce you to less than 1 HP, reduces
you to 1 HP instead.
