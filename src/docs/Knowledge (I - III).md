# Knowledge (I - III)

**Cost: 2 per tier**

## Description

Whether through extensive study or years of first hand experience, you
have knowledge of a particular subject which far surpasses your general
intelligence. A navigator well versed in the galactic map, a barbarian
warlord with years of experience with military strategy, and a professor
of the paranormal are all examples of this feat in play.

## Effect

When you take this feat, choose a sphere of knowledge from the list
below or, with the GM's approval, create a new one.

Example spheres of knowledge include alchemy, anatomy, arcane,
computers, explosives, engineering, geography, herbalism, history,
location (must specify), medicine, military strategy, supernatural, and
wilderness.

Your tier in this feat determines how knowledgeable you are within your
chosen sphere.

    your chosen sphere of knowledge with a CR of 16 or lower. For higher
    CRs, your [Spirit](Spirit.md) attribute is considered to be 3 for the action

    case you gain advantage 1 on the roll.
-   **Tier 2** - You automatically succeed on any action roll related to
    your chosen sphere of knowledge with a CR of 22 or lower. For higher
    CRs, your [Spirit](Spirit.md) attribute is considered to be 6 for the action
    roll unless your [Spirit](Spirit.md) score is already 6 or higher, in which
    case you gain advantage 1 on the roll.
-   **Tier 3** - You automatically succeed on any action roll related to
    your chosen sphere of knowledge with a CR of 26 or lower. For higher
    CRs, your [Spirit](Spirit.md) attribute is considered to be 8 for the action
    roll unless your [Spirit](Spirit.md) score is already 8 or higher, in which
    case you gain advantage 1 on the roll.
