# Brutal Intimidation

**Cost: 1**

## Description

Your powers of persuasion stem from application of brute force rather
than your social grace. When you smash a table, brandish your blade, or
flex your muscles, people stop what they are doing and listen to you.

## Effect

If you're able to make a show of physical force, you can use your [Power](Power.md)
attribute in place of [Spirit](Spirit.md) for the action roll.
