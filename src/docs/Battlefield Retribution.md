# Battlefield Retribution

**Cost: 2**

## Description

You are a master of the counter attack. This might take the form of
deftly redirecting a strike back upon the attacker or even energetic
feedback from an extraordinary barrier that damages the attacker. Your
prowess on the battlefield allows you to not only intercept attacks but
also decimate your foes with retributive damage.

## Effect

When you use the defend interrupt action, you also deal damage to the
attacker equal to the amount by which your action roll exceeds the
attacker's roll.
