# Advantage & Disadvantage

These mechanics modify rolls based on situational circumstances.

A character can spend [Legend Points](Legend Points.md) to grant themselves advantage

## Mechanics

- Expressed with a numeric level (e.g., "advantage 2").
- Multiple instances are cumulative. If you have both, subtract the smaller value from the larger.
- **Advantage:** Roll X extra attribute dice, where X is your advantage level. Before totaling, ignore the lowest X attribute dice rolled.
- **Disadvantage:** Roll X extra attribute dice, where X is your disadvantage level. Before totaling, ignore the highest X attribute dice rolled.
- This mechanic applies only to the initial dice pool, not to dice re-rolled from explosions.

## Rolls without Attribute Dice

- For rolls with an attribute score of 0.
- **Advantage 1:** Roll 2d20 and take the higher result.
- **Disadvantage 1:** Roll 2d20 and take the lower result.
- Advantage/disadvantage cannot exceed a level of 1 for these rolls.

## Assigning Advantage & Disadvantage

- **Situational (GM-assigned):** The GM can assign advantage 1 or disadvantage 1 for temporary circumstances (e.g., flanking an enemy, fighting on a narrow beam). This should not be stacked.
- **Rules-based:** Feats, banes, and boons can grant higher and cumulative levels of advantage or disadvantage.
