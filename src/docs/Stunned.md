## Description

You disorient the target's senses, causing them to act much less
efficiently. Stunning an enemy can be caused by attacks such as a pistol
whip to the back of the head, a kick in the groin, and a deafening
thunderclap.

## Effect

During the target's turn, they are limited to either a single major
action, a single move action, or a single minor action. Effects that
grant additional actions do not circumvent this unless they grant a free
action. Note that a target expending its move action to resist this bane
will receive the remainder of their usual actions if the resist roll
succeeds.
