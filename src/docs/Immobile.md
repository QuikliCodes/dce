## Description

Whether through grappling, a precise nerve strike, entangling vines,
mental compulsion, or a bone-numbing blast of cold, you render your foe
incapable of movement. This bane is typical among martial artists,
special ops agents, enchanters, and wrestlers.

## Effect

Your target cannot move from its current space. If you invoked the bane
with a [Power](Power.md) roll and are within 1 hex of the target, then both you and
the target are immobile in your current space for the duration of the
bane (locked in a grapple). While grappling in this manner, you can
attempt to inflict this bane again upon the target. If successful, you
can move your speed and take the target with you. If this attack fails,
you can only move by first releasing the target and ending the bane. If
you invoked the bane with any attribute other than [Power](Power.md), you can move
freely while the target remains affected. You can choose to release the
target as a free action, immediately ending the bane.
