## Description

You summon forth a creature to assist your cause, whether they are
animals called from the wild, undead minions built from the remains of
your foes, or worker bots constructed of spare parts from a salvage
yard. This boon is favored by druids, conjurers, engineers,
necromancers, and mad scientists.

## Effect

You create or summon a temporary NPC companion that is under your
control, though of limited intelligence. Your minion's statistics are
determined by the power level of this boon. You may assign the
attributes as you see fit. Your minion's attributes do not
affect their hit points or defenses.

| 5           | 5          | 12       | 3, 2, 2    |
| 6           | 6          | 13       | 4, 3, 3    |
| 7           | 7          | 14       | 5, 4, 4    |
| 8           | 8          | 15       | 6, 5, 5    |

Your minion cannot act on the turn that it is summoned. On each of your
following turns, your minion acts on your initiative count according to
your direction, receiving the usual assortment of actions. You are
limited to a maximum number of summoned creatures equal to your invoking
attribute score. Feats and other abilities cannot increase this limit.
