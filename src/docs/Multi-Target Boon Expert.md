# Multi-Target Boon Expert

**Cost: 3**

## Description

You have so mastered the art of aiding groups of allies that you can
invoke certain boons effortlessly. A healing nova, a supernatural wind
that gives flight to a group, and a time dilation that hastens a group
of allies are all examples of this feat in action.

## Effect

When multi-targeting a boon for which you have the Boon Focus feat, you
do not need to make an action roll if the disadvantage normally incurred
from multi-targeting is completely negated by your Multi-Target Boon
Specialist feat. Your invocation automatically succeeds.
