# Bane Focus

**Cost: 3**

## Description

You are specialized in the use of a particular bane that is iconic to
your character. Perhaps you are a martial artist known for your stunning
strikes, a sniper who knows how to slow a target's escape, or a fire
mage who sets enemies ablaze with persistent burning damage.

## Effect

Choose a bane that you can invoke. When your roll on a damaging attack
exceeds the target's defense by 5 or more (as opposed to the usual 10),
you can inflict this bane for free. Each attack is still only capable of
inflicting a single bane. Furthermore, when making a bane attack to
inflict your chosen bane, you gain advantage 2 on the bane attack roll.
