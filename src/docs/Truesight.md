# Truesight

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 5
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Sustain Persists

## Description

You grant yourself or an ally the ability to perceive that which cannot
be detected with mundane senses, piercing impediments that would block
or deceive normal sight, including darkness, solid objects, illusions,
and even the barrier between alternate planes of reality. This power may
stem from extrasensory perception, divine blessing, cybernetically
enhanced senses, or similar means.

## Effect

-   **Power Level 5** - The target sees the presence of extraordinary
    effects such as magic, cloaking technology, and other effects that
    could be seen through extra-visual perception. In addition, this
    boon grants advantage 1 on rolls used to detect mundane concealment
    such as hidden passages, furniture with hidden storage, and
    concealed traps or other hazards.
-   **Power Level 6** - The target's extraordinary sight pierces
    natural and magical darkness.
-   **Power Level 7** - The target's extraordinary sight pierces
    through all illusory effects, allowing them to see a *phantasm* for
    what it is.
-   **Power Level 8** - The target can see through solid objects and
    their natural visual range is unhindered by them.
-   **Power Level 9** - The extraordinary sight enables the target to
    peer into alternate planes or dimensions. They can see into
    dimensional pockets and other planes that overlap with the one they
    are currently on. In addition, the target's visual range becomes
    supercharged.
