# Aura

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 4
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Sustain Persists

## Description

You surround a willing target in an aura that hurts their foes or helps
their allies. A shield of gamma radiation that burns attackers, a circle
of healing, and an aura of elemental protection are all examples of this
boon in action.

## Effect

An aura extends from a willing target to a distance determined by the
power level of this boon:

-   **Power Level 4** - 1 hex radius
-   **Power Level 6** - 2 hex radius
-   **Power Level 8** - 3 hex radius

Choose a single bane or boon which uses the same attribute that you used
to invoke Aura. The maximum power level for the chosen bane or boon is
one-half the power level of your aura. Your aura radiates the chosen
bane or boon as follows:

-   **If the aura radiates a bane,** then the target of the aura is not
    affected by it. All other creatures (friend or foe) who willingly
    enter the area of the aura or end their turn within it suffer a bane
    attack to inflict the chosen bane. No creature may be subject to a
    bane attack from the same creature's aura more than once per round.
-   **If the aura radiates a boon,** then the target of the aura is also
    affected by it. The target and all allies who end their turn within
    the area of the aura automatically gain the chosen boon. Upon
    leaving the area of the aura, the boon is immediately removed. No
    creature may gain a boon from the same creature's aura more than
    once per round.
