# Potent Bane

**Cost: 3**

## Description

You are so adept at a particular form of attack that your foes struggle
to shake off the effects. Perhaps the flames of your fireballs burn
hotter. Or maybe you've developed a special chemical to mix in with
your blinding powder. Whatever the source and whatever the effect, most
enemies are incapable of recovering from your legendary attack.

## Effect

Choose one bane that you can invoke that has a duration of \"resist
ends\". When a target makes a resist roll to shake off your invocation
of the chosen bane, they have disadvantage 1.
