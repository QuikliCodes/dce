# Truthfulness

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 5
-   Invocation Time: 10 Minutes
-   Duration: 10 minutes (special)

## Attributes

-   Spirit

## Description

By controlling the target's mind through compulsion magic, chemical
injection, neural probes, or similar means, you render them incapable of
lying deliberately. This is a favored bane among enchanters, mad
scientists, psychics, and thought police.

## Effect

The target answers any question asked with honesty, to the best of their
knowledge. When compelled to reveal something they would not reveal outside of
duress, the target makes a [Recovery](Recovery.md) roll and you make an
[Spirit](Spirit.md) roll. If the target's roll is higher than yours, then they
resist the bane and the effect ends.
