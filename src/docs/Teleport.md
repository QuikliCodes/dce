# Teleport

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 3
-   Invocation Time: 1 Move Action
-   Duration: Instantaneous

## Description

You are able to instantly move yourself or an ally from one place to
another, either by stepping into an intermediate realm, deconstructing
and reforming a physical body, transporting magically, or similar means.

## Effect

-   **Power Level 3** - You can teleport the target to any unoccupied
    space within 5 feet per [Speed](Speed.md) or [Spirit](Spirit.md) attribute score as long as you can
    naturally see your destination.
-   **Power Level 5** - Your teleportation range is unchanged, but you
    can now teleport your target to spaces that you can't see. If you
    choose an occupied space, your target lands in the nearest adjacent
    space (roll randomly to decide if there are multiple options) and
    your target is stunned for 1 round (a resist roll is not needed to
    end the effect).
-   **Power Level 7** - You can opt to take longer in invoking the boon.
    If you choose to do so, for each minute of invocation (delay before
    making your action roll) you can teleport the target 1 mile, up to a
    maximum number of miles equal to your [Speed](Speed.md) or [Spirit](Spirit.md) attribute score.
    While the distance is greater, this mode is also dangerous, as a
    misunderstanding of direction or geography can put your target many
    miles in an unfavorable direction. You simply choose a direction
    (relative to your starting location) and teleport your target a
    number of miles equal to your [Speed](Speed.md) or [Spirit](Spirit.md) score. During invocation, you
    must spend a focus action each turn until the invocation time
    passes.
-   **Power Level 9** - Using the same longer invocation time for power
    level 7, you can now teleport your target to any location without
    range limit, provided you have personally seen (through magical or
    normal means) the destination.
