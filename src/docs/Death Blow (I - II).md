# Death Blow (I - II)

**Cost: 3 per tier**

## Description

You are able to quickly finish off enemies that are near death and
silence them before they cry out. This attack is one that is commonly
seen used by rogues, assassins, and snipers who can silently eliminate
weaker enemies without being detected.

## Effect

-   **Tier 1** - If you damage an enemy with a Lethal Strike and their
    total HP is 5 or less after the attack, then you can choose to
    reduce them to zero HP instead. In addition, you can choose to
    silence any enemy reduced to zero hit points by an attack from you.
-   **Tier 2** - Your death blow HP threshold increases from 5 to 10. In
    addition, on a successful Lethal Strike, the *stunned* bane is
    automatically inflicted without counting against your usual 1 bane
    per attack limit.
