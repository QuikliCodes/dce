# Skill Specialization (I - V)

**Cost: 2 per tier**

## Description

You have the eyes of an eagle, the endurance of an ox, the guile of a
fox, or some similarly exceptional non-combat talent. It might come from
intense training, prolonged study, or even an inherent natural talent.

## Effect

Choose one attribute. Any time you make a roll using the chosen
attribute that is not for initiative, attacks, invocations, or the
defend action, you gain advantage 1 on the roll per tier of this feat
you possess for that attribute.
