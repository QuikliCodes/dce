# Companion (I - III)

**Cost: 2 per tier**

## Description

Whether a hired bodyguard, a loyal animal sidekick, or a sibling that
follows you everywhere, you have the constant and unflinching loyalty of
one particular companion character.

## Effect

You gain a companion character that acts independently from you. During
combat, your companion acts on its own initiative count and gains the
usual assortment of actions, which you may choose. You also get to
assign your companion's attributes. Whenever you gain a level or
purchase a new tier in this feat, you may reassign your companion's
attributes and feats.

-   **Tier 1** - Your companion has a total of 20 attribute points plus
    4 per level of your character.
-   **Tier 2** - Your companion receives 3 feat points.
-   **Tier 3** - Your companion has a total of 30 attribute points plus
    6 per level of your character. In addition, you can optionally grant
    feats to your companion. In order to do so, you spend your own feat
    points and the companion receives the feat instead of you. The
    companion, not you, must meet all feat prerequisites. Any math
    related to these feats are calculated based on the companion's
    attributes, feats, etc. If you have spent feat points this way and
    would gain feat points from any other effect, those feat points are
    reduced by the number of feat points you have granted to your
    companion.
