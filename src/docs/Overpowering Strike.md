# Overpowering Strike

**Cost: 2**

## Description

In combat, you are like a wrecking ball that clears the battlefield of
your foes. The sheer force of your attacks is so great that you send
opponents flying. A half-ogre wielding a massive tree branch and a super
soldier trained to use the enemy's weight against themself are both
examples of this feat in play.

## Effect

Each time you deal damage using a weapon that has the *forceful*
property, you can choose to push the target five feet away from you.
