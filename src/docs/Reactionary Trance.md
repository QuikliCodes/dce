# Reactionary Trance

**Cost: 2**

## Description

Your intense focus never lapses, allowing you to tap into your
heightened battle trance at a moment's notice. Examples of this feat in
play include a hulking brute who snaps into a rage at the first sign of
danger and a trained gunslinger who is always ready for a fight.

## Effect

You can enter a battle trance (as per the Battle Trance feat) as a free
action even when it is not your turn. You may choose to do so in
reaction to another action, such as an enemy's attack, spell, or
insult. You may even declare your intent to enter a battle trance after
the action has been resolved (such as after the attack has already been
rolled). The benefits granted from your battle trance take place before
the triggering action is resolved, potentially negating damage or
harmful effects that you would have otherwise incurred.
