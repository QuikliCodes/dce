# Hallucination (I - II)

**Cost: 3 per tier**

## Description

You are able to use your powers of illusion to not only create
phantasmal figments, but to completely dominate the sensory perceptions
of individual targets. Such power is wielded by the likes of legendary
enchanters, psychics, and shamans. Those who can master such powers are
often capable of neutralizing angry mobs without shedding a drop of
blood.

## Effect

-   **Tier 1** - When you invoke the *phantasm* bane, you may choose to
    create a hallucination within a single target's mind instead of an
    illusion that is perceptible to everyone. You gain complete control
    over the target's senses (as granted by the power level of your
    bane), and thus the hallucination is not restricted by size or area.
    Your hallucination may only target a single creature and is not
    eligible for multi-targeting attacks. In addition, unless the target
    is damaged, they suffer disadvantage on resist rolls against the
    bane.
-   **Tier 2** - When you invoke the hallucination form of the
    *phantasm* bane, you may target additional creatures within range as
    determined by your [Spirit](Spirit.md) score. This does not count as a
    multi-target attack and thus does not incur disadvantage on your
    action roll.
    -   **Spirit 7** - 5 targets
    -   **Spirit 8** - 10 targets
    -   **Spirit 9** - 50 targets
