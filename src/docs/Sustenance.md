    an alternate source, such as by breathing the oxygen found in water,
    drinking from an irradiated stream, or eating food not normally
    edible

    nourishment periodically required for sustenance, such as food or
    water.

    nourishment, that which is typically consumed on a moment-to-moment
    basis, such as air.

    biological necessities, including warmth, water, air, food, and any
    other biological need.
