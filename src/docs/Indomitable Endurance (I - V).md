# Indomitable Endurance (I - V)

**Cost: 2 per tier**

## Description

Your endurance and willpower are legendary, allowing you to push on when
others would keel over from exhaustion. A barbarian able to recover
their wind after a mighty frenzy, or a computer hacker capable of
routinely going for days without sleep while focused on a singular
objective are good examples of this feat in action.

## Effect

You are able to shrug off the effects of the *[Fatigued](Fatigued.md)* bane. For each
tier you possess in this feat, treat your fatigue level as one lower
than it actually is for the purposes of determining the bane's effects.
