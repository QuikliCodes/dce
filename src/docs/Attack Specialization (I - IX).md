# Attack Specialization (I - IX)

**Cost: 3 per tier**

## Description

Like a samurai who masters the art of the katana or an elementalist who
specializes in summoning flame, you are so well trained with a
particular form of attack that you can devastate foes with much more
skill than the average combatant.

## Effect

When you take this feat, select one weapon or attack type. You gain
advantage 1 per tier of this feat for any *damaging* attack made with
your chosen attack type. This bonus does not apply to bane attacks or
boon invocations. Examples of attack types you can choose to specialize
in include fire, cold, lightning, acid, poison, entropy, and force -
though this list is not exhaustive.
