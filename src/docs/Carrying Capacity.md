# Carrying Capacity

- **Item Limit:** You can carry a maximum of 20 tracked items. Minor items or items stored together (like arrows in a quiver) count as a single item at the GM's discretion.
- **Heavy Items:** You can carry a number of items with the `heavy` property equal to your [Power](Power.md) score. Carrying your maximum allotment of heavy items halves your [Movement Speed](Speed.md#movement-speed) (rounded down).
- **Bulky Items:** You can carry one item with the `bulky` property at no penalty. Carrying a second reduces your movement speed to 5 feet.
