# Swimming

**Cost: 1**

## Description

You are made for the water and can swim at surprising speeds with the
aptitude of a fish. This might be the result of hard core training, or
it may stem from a racial trait, such as webbed feet and hands.

## Effect

You gain a swimming speed equal to your base speed and do not need to
make any special action rolls to maintain this base speed.
