# Battlefield Punisher

**Cost: 3**

## Description

Not only can you deal out retributive damage, you can devastate your
opponents with a signature secondary effect. Examples of this feat in
action include a stalwart paladin who knocks foes prone, a ninja who
blinds enemies, or a telekinetic psychic who hurls attacks away.

## Effect

Choose a bane you can inflict. Any time you use the defend action with
an attribute that could inflict the chosen bane and deal 10 damage via
the Battlefield Retribution feat, you may choose to automatically
afflict the attacker with the chosen bane.
