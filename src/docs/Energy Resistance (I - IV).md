# Energy Resistance (I - IV)

**Cost: 2 per tier**

## Description

Whether due to inherited racial traits, specialization in a particular
type of energy, or inherent extraordinary protection, you are resistant
to a specific type of energy. A fiery sorceress immune to the hottest
blaze or a biologically anomalous alien race that is immune to poison
are both examples of this feat in play.

## Effect

Choose from the following energy types: fire, cold, lightning, acid,
poison, or another at the GM's discretion. When you are attacked with
that energy type, you gain resistance to the attack as follows:

-   **Tier 1** - Your defense scores are increased by 3 against the
    chosen energy type.
-   **Tier 2** - Your defense scores are increased by 6 against the
    chosen energy type.
-   **Tier 3** - Your defense scores are increased by 9 against the
    chosen energy type.
-   **Tier 4** - You are immune to damage and harmful effects from the
    chosen energy type.
