# Attributes

Attributes increase in power based on their [Attribute Score](Attribute Score.md), which can be purchased with [Attribute Points](Attribute Points.md)

- **[Power](Power.md):** Swing a maul, jump over a chasm, break down a door, wrestle a foe to submission
- **[Recovery](Recovery.md):** Resist poison, shrug off pain, survive a desert, wear heavy armor
- **[Speed](Speed.md):** Dodge attacks, move with stealth, perform acrobatics, shoot a bow, pick a pocket
- **[Spirit](Spirit.md):** Use magic, sense emotions, detect auras

Perception and Social attributes are generally not available in this system, though some 
can be modeled off of Spirit or Power.  Perception is generally done through Spirit,
though for extraordinary mental or social abilities, these are provided through boons
and feats, rather than strictly through attributes.
