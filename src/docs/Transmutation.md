## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 3
-   Invocation Time: 1 Minute

## Description

You are able to change the size, shape, and composition of physical
matter that you touch. Transmute rocks to gold, a wall into a door, or a
lump of metal into a loaded gun. This boon is favored among druids,
transmuters, engineers, and mad scientists.

## Effect

Your power level determines the types of matter you can transmute as
well as the duration of the effect. The duration is either *temporary*
or *permanent*. A **temporary** transmutation must be sustained every
round. A **permanent** transmutation does not have to be sustained and
persists until some other effect would cancel it. The maximum volume of
matter you can transmute is on 5 cubic feet multiplied by your attribute
score.
