# Special Equipment

## Extraordinary Items

These are items with magical or advanced technological properties. They are acquired via questing, crafting, or purchase (with GM approval) and have a Wealth Level.

- **Item Attributes/Banes/Boons:** An item can possess its own attribute scores, or the ability to invoke specific [banes](Banes.md) and [boons](Boons.md) at a set [attribute score](Attribute Score.md). The wielder uses the item's score for the [roll](Action Roll.md). If the wielder's own score is higher, they may use it instead and gain [advantage](Advantage.md) 1.
- **Key Properties:**
    - **Augmenting:** Applies a [bane](Banes.md) to a weapon attack. Consumed on use.
    - **Autonomous:** Triggers a specific action under a pre-set condition.
    - **Baneful (Bane):** On a damaging attack that exceeds the target's defense by 5+, you may automatically inflict the specified [bane](Banes.md).
    - **Consumable:** Can be used once to automatically invoke a single-target [boon](Boons.md).
    - **Cursed (Bane):** Afflicts the wielder with a [bane](Banes.md) that cannot be resisted normally.
    - **Deadly (X):** Grants [advantage](Advantage.md) X on attacks made with the weapon.
    - **Persistent (Boon):** The item automatically invokes and sustains the specified [boon](Boons.md) for the wielder.
    - **Weapon/Armor (Type):** The item functions as a standard weapon or armor of the specified type, inheriting its base properties.

## Legendary Items

These are unique, plot-central items that are too powerful to show up for sale in marketplaces.

- They can have any property of an extraordinary item, plus unique legendary properties:
  - **Attribute Bonus/Penalty:** Directly modifies the wielder's [attribute score](Attribute Score.md).
  - **Intelligent:** The item is sentient and can communicate.
  - **Unfailing:** Any die result of 1 is treated as the maximum value and explodes.
  - **Slaying (Creature Type):** On an attack that exceeds the target's defense by 5+, the target creature of the specified type immediately dies.
