# Unending Charm

**Cost: 3**

## Description

Whether you are an enchanter, psychic, or mad scientist, you have
mastered the art of enthralling others. Your charms are so potent that
your victims may fall permanently under your compulsion.

## Effect

When you invoke the *charmed* bane, targets who do not make their resist
roll within 24 hours of being afflicted become permanently affected by
the bane. They do not receive any more resist rolls to shake themselves
free of the effect. Other extraordinary effects like a *nullify* bane
can still end the effect (and other methods may work at the GM's
discretion).
