# Blindsight

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 5
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Sustain Persists

## Description

Even in the absence of light you are able to distinguish your
surroundings. Some examples of blindsight include tremorsense,
echolocation, heat vision, divine insight, or extraordinarily heightened
senses.

## Effect

The target is immune to the blinded bane and they are able to see
normally even in conditions of little or no light. Blindsight can also
potentially counter invisiblity, though the GM will have to decide if
the source creating the blindsight is appropriate to counter the source
creating the invisible boon.
