## Description

Whether via a thunderous blow from a great axe, an earth shattering bolt
of supernatural energy, or a well aimed shove in a direction where the
enemy's balance is weak, you knock the target off their feet. Knockdown
is a favorite of hulking brutes, telekinetisists, martial artists, and
earth elementalists.

## Effect

The target falls prone. Prone targets have disadvantage 1 on all attacks
they make. Characters that are prone due to the *knockdown* bane (or any
other reason) get +2 to Guard versus Ranged attacks and -2 Guard versus
Melee attacks. Standing up from prone requires a move action and costs a
character half (round down) of their speed for the round.
