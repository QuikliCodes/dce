# Two Weapon Defense

**Cost: 2**

## Description

Your mastery of two weapon fighting allows you not only to come at your
foes with a flurry of attacks, but also to shield yourself exceptionally
well by deflecting incoming attacks with your weapons. Duelists,
rangers, and space pirates are all concepts that could make use of this
feat.

## Effect

When you wield a weapon you've taken the Attack Specialization feat for
in each hand, you gain a +1 armor bonus to your Guard defense.
