# Craft Extraordinary Item (I - III)

**Cost: 3 per tier**

## Description

You are studied in the ways of imbuing magical items, building
futuristic technology, brewing potions, or crafting extraordinary
devices. Their power is permanent but varies depending on your skill.

## Effect

Provided you have the appropriate working space and materials (as determined by
the GM), you can create extraordinary items (as detailed in Chapter 9: Special
Equipment). You can only imbue an item with attributes, banes, and boons that
you can access. For example, in order to create a sword with [Speed](Speed.md)
5, you must possess a [Speed](Speed.md) score of 5 or higher.  Your tier in
this feat determines the maximum wealth level of the items you can create,
based on the attribute you are using to craft:

-   **Tier 1** - Maximum wealth level equals attribute minus 2
-   **Tier 2** - Maximum wealth level equals attribute minus 1
-   **Tier 3** - Maximum wealth level equals attribute

For example, a character with [Spirit](Spirit.md) 5 and tier 1 in this feat could
create items up to wealth level 3. You can determine the wealth level of
the item you want to create by consulting the sample items in **Chapter
9: Special Equipment** or by developing a custom item using the rules
for **Building Your Own Extraordinary Items** in that chapter. Creating
an item with the *consumable* or *expendable* property requires one full
8-hour day of uninterrupted work. Other items require a duration of
uninterrupted work based on their wealth level, as follows:

-   **Wealth Level 1 - 3**: Two days per wealth level.
-   **Wealth Level 4 - 5**: Four days per wealth level.
-   **Wealth Level 6 - 7**: One week per wealth level.
-   **Wealth Level 8 - 9**: One month per wealth level.

At the end of this time, your item is created. Crafting an item still
counts as an expenditure of wealth, so you must have a sufficient wealth
score to purchase the item, following all the rules for spending wealth
provided in **Chapter 5: Wealth & Equipment**. The GM may waive some or
all of the costs associated with an item if you possess special
materials for the crafting of your item. For example, if you have
recently collected the hide of a slain red dragon and decide to make a
suit of Armor of Fire Resistance, the GM may decide that the dragon's
hide is enough to make up most of the costs of the armor, so the armor's
wealth level is reduced by 3 for purposes of determining crafting costs.
