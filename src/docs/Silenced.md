## Properties

## Description

Silence overcomes the target, whether from the warping of sound around
the target, or from a physical effect like strangulation or suffocation.
The silence bane is a favorite among assassins, sorcerers, engineers,
and mad scientists.

## Effect

If [Power](Power.md) or [Speed](Speed.md) is used to inflict this bane, then
the character is suffering strangulation and unable to speak. If the bane is
inflicted using [Spirit](Spirit.md), then all sound within 1 hex of the target
is suppressed through extraordinary means, making their footsteps and the usual
clank of belongings they are carrying inaudible.
