# Fatigued

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 5
-   Invocation Time: 1 Major Action
-   Duration: Special

## Attributes

-   Spirit

## Description

You cause the target's body to wither and weaken, gradually losing its
ability to function until the victim finally succumbs to death. Fatigue
may be the result of a necromancer's curse, an assassin's poison, a
radiation ray, or similar life sapping effects.

## Effect

This bane has multiple tiers which are applied in succession. Each time
this bane is inflicted, if it is already in effect on the target, the
severity escalates by one level.

-   **Level 1** - The target has disadvantage 1 on all non-attack action
    rolls.
-   **Level 2** - The target is affected by the slowed bane, reducing
    its speed by half. This instance of the slowed bane cannot be
    resisted as normal. It persists until the fatigue is removed.
-   **Level 3** - The target has disadvantage 1 on all attack rolls.
-   **Level 4** - The target loses their attribute bonuses to their
    defense scores. They retain any armor,
    extraordinary, or feat bonuses.
-   **Level 5** - The target loses consciousness and is helpless. Being
    forced into a state of rest, one level of fatigue will be removed
    automatically after 24 hours, unless circumstances prevent the
    target from resting peacefully.
-   **Level 6** - The target dies.
