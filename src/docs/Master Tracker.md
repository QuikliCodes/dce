# Master Tracker

**Cost: 1**

## Description

You were made for the hunt. Whether you gained this ability through
years of practice or possess it through heightened senses, the effect is
the same: once you've picked up a trail, you almost never lose track of
your quarry.

## Effect

Unless blinded or thwarted through extraordinary means, you always know
the direction of true north. In addition, once you successfully locate
the trail of a target, you automatically succeed at all tracking
attempts to continue following that trail for 7 days after the time you
first picked it up. Only extraordinary concealment, targets in flight,
or similarly exceptional cases can cause you to lose your mark.
