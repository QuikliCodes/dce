# Sworn Enemy (I - IX)

**Cost: 1 per tier**

## Description

You are expertly focused on dealing with a particular species, race, or
faction. Perhaps your family was slain by werewolves, and you have
devoted your life to studying their mannerisms in order to hunt them
down. Or maybe you were raised in a prison on the third moon of Vogax
Prime, and you know the Vogans better than they know themselves.

## Effect

Choose a species, race, or faction (e.g., dragons, Void Templars, gnolls, or
vampires). You learn the primary conversational language of that species, and
at the GM's discretion, you may have some level of access to other special
forms of communication (such as thieves' cant or secret hand signals).
Furthermore, you gain advantage 1 per tier of this feat to all attribute rolls
to learn things pertaining to your chosen group.
