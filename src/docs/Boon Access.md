# Boon Access

**Cost: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9**

## Description

You have a special gift: it might be the result of your heritage, a
close encounter with magical energy, or the result of years of training
with a master. In any case, although you do not necessarily possess the
aptitude to work extraordinary powers for yourself or create a desired
effect with your physical capabilities alone, you are able to reliably
replicate a single boon.

## Effect

When you choose this feat, choose one boon that you do not have the
requisite attribute to invoke. The cost of this feat is equal to the
power level of the chosen boon. You can invoke the chosen boon despite
lacking the necessary attribute. For invocation rolls, treat your
attribute score as the power level of the boon. If the boon has multiple
attribute prerequisite options, you choose one attribute when you take
this feat. Additionally, you count as having access to the chosen boon
for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites, and your attribute for
meeting such prerequisites is equal to the power level of the boon. The
Boon Access feat bypasses the normal attribute score restrictions based
on character level, so a first level character could spend all 6 of
their feat points to begin play with access to a power level 6 boon. You
may acquire this feat multiple times. Each time, select a new boon.
