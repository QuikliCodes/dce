# Extraordinary Focus

**Cost: 3**

## Description

Your extraordinary power stems from your connection with a particular
focus, such as a wand, digital psi amplifier, holy symbol, or spellbook.
When this focus item is in your hands, you are a force to be reckoned
with compared to others with similar powers.

## Effect

With the approval of your GM, choose a focus from which your power with
a single extraordinary attribute stems. Some possibilities include a
wand, a digital psi amplifier, a crystal ball, a spell book, a holy
symbol, a weapon, your voice, or an animal familiar. You cannot use the
selected extraordinary attribute without your focus. The focus heightens
your power and for the purposes of determining your attribute dice for
action rolls, you treat the chosen attribute as if it was one greater.
For all purposes outside of attribute dice, your ability score remains
unchanged (feats, banes, boons, etc.).
