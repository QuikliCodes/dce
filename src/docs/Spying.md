# Spying

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 5
-   Invocation Time: 10 Minutes
-   Duration: 10 minutes (special)

## Attributes

-   Spirit

## Description

Either through innate extrasensory perception or a special conduit such
as a computer terminal, bubbling cauldron, or a crystal ball, you can
view the target from a distance.

## Effect

You can spy on a person or area that you are familiar with. The power
level of this bane determines the maximum distance between you and the
target. If successfully invoked, you can see and hear everything that
goes on within a 12 hex radius of your target. Anyone within the targeted
area who has a Resolve defense score higher than your [Spirit](Spirit.md) action
roll to invoke this bane becomes aware of an unseen presence in the area
(regardless of whether or not you succeed at the roll). Certain
creatures may be able to identify your spying if they are familiar with
such powers.

    discretion).
