# Craft Mundane Item (I - II)

**Cost: 2 per tier**

## Description

You have mastered a particular craft, and given proper time and
materials, you can create items related to that craft. You might be an
expert blacksmith, professional engineer, master alchemist, or any
similar manner of professional craftsman.

## Effect

Choose a specific craft or profession. You can create items that are
relevant to your chosen craft, and your GM will determine the speed at
which you craft based on the nature of the item and the materials you
have access to. Your tier in the Craft Mundane Item feat determines the
maximum wealth level of the items you can craft. Unlike acquiring items
by using your wealth (described in Chapter 5), crafting does not limit
your ability to acquire additional goods.

-   **Tier 1** - You can craft items equal to your wealth level.
-   **Tier 2** - You can craft items equal to your wealth level + 1.

**Craft Examples** (This list is not exhaustive, and you can work with
your GM to come up with other suitable crafts):

-   Alchemy - acid, chemicals, non-magical tinctures, incense, reagents.
-   Arcane - magical ingredients, inks, scrolls, exotic components.
-   Blacksmithing - metal, leather, weapons, armor, wheels, horseshoes.
-   Chemistry - acid, explosives, narcotics.
-   Engineering - machines, wheels, gears, guns, vehicles.
-   Geography - maps, cartography, instruments of navigation.
-   Herbalism - poultices, natural remedies, stimulants, brewing.

    anti-toxins.
