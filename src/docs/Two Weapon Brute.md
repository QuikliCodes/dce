# Two Weapon Brute

**Cost: 3**

## Description

Being both physically powerful and incredibly agile, you are able to
wield a weapon in one-hand that requires two hands for others. Good
examples of this feat in action include an orcish barbarian wielding a
great axe and shield and a survivor in the zombie apocalypse wielding
two chainsaws.

## Effect

You can wield weapons with the two-handed property in one hand and you
gain the benefits of both the two-handed and one-handed property while
doing so. This means that you gain a total of advantage 2 when wielding
a two-handed weapon in each hand, advantage 1 from the power of a
two-handed weapon plus advantage 1 from having one weapon in each hand.
