# Regeneration

## Properties

-   Min. Power Level: 1

## Description

The target gains an extraordinary ability to heal their wounds. Examples
of this include the supernatural regeneration of a troll, a super
soldier's adrenal biomod, or the ability to channel energy that results
in continous healing. Regardless of the source, wounds close before the
very eyes of an onlooker.

## Effect

While the regeneration boon is sustained, the target heals hit points at
the beginning of each of the *boon invoker's* turns. The amount of
healing is determined by the power level of the boon.
