# Battle Trance

**Cost: 3**

## Description

You can enter a heightened mental state of combat readiness, in which
your body is strengthened and your mind transcends fear and pain.
Examples include a raging barbarian or an unstoppable samurai with laser
focus in the heat of battle.

## Effect

As a free action on your turn, you may enter a battle trance. While
entranced, you have advantage 1 on all attacks. Additionally, your
Toughness and Resolve defenses are increased by 3. If your total armor
bonus is less than 3, it becomes 3. If you take three consecutive turns
without making an attack roll against an enemy creature, the battle
trance ends. When the battle trance ends, you automatically suffer 1
level of the [Fatigue Bane](Fatigued.md).
