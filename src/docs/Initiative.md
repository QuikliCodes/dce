# Initiative

1. **Determine Surprise:** The GM may call for a contested roll (e.g., [Speed](Speed.md) vs. [Speed](Speed.md)) to see if any combatants are surprised. Surprised characters cannot take interrupt actions and attacks against them have [Advantage](Advantage.md) 1 until they take their first turn.
2. **Roll for Initiative:** Each combatant makes an Speed roll. Turns are taken from highest to lowest initiative. Surprised combatants act after all non-surprised combatants.
