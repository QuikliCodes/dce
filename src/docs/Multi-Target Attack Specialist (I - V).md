# Multi-Target Attack Specialist (I - V)

**Cost: 2 per tier**

## Description

You are a master of wreaking havoc on many foes at once, whether it be
with a whirlwind of your twin blades, a hail of gun fire, a massive wave
of psionic energy, or a devastating ball of flame.

## Effect

When you choose this feat, you must decide to focus in area, ranged, or
melee attacks. For each tier, you reduce the disadvantage penalty
associated with multi-targeting for your chosen attack type by 1.
